# PACZero SmolLM validation aggregate report

Overall success: **True**

## Scope and claim boundary

Fast validation SmolLM MLX adaptation of PACZero-ZPL mechanism, with smoke-scale utility preservation checks; not paper-scale utility reproduction.

## Paper-concept to MLX-evidence map

| Paper concept | MLX evidence |
|---|---|
| `PACZero_ZPL_I_Sstar_Y_1T_equals_0_mechanism` | addressed by strict transcript audit: unanimous releases subset-independent, disagreement releases RNG-derived, zero release-rule violations |
| `M_126_ZPL_setting` | addressed across both tasks |
| `LoRA_rank8_alpha16` | addressed across both ZPL tasks and non-private utility controls |
| `q_proj_v_proj_target_fidelity` | addressed across all SmolLM layers; 60 q/v targets |
| `SST2_and_SQuAD_task_coverage` | addressed with small-scale data paths; SQuAD uses gold-answer likelihood, not generated EM/F1 |
| `utility_preservation_smoke` | addressed by requiring ZPL selected checkpoints and non-private ZO controls to be not worse than frozen baseline on the selection metric |
| `audit_soundness_negative_control` | addressed by deliberately making disagreement releases depend on S_star and requiring the audit to fail that case |

## Negative-control audit

Present: **True**
Success: **True**
Good ZPL release passes audit: **True**
Bad secret-dependent release fails audit: **True**

## Limitations explicitly not claimed

- Not a full OPT-1.3B/OPT-6.7B reproduction.
- Not paper-scale 1000/500/1000 data or 1000 ZPL steps.
- SQuAD metric is label-only gold-answer likelihood, not generated EM/F1.
- Utility numbers are smoke-scale; they demonstrate preservation relative to frozen baseline, not paper-level utility parity.
- The MLX demo uses normalized ZO directions and fixed mu/lr for fast stable execution; it is not a byte-for-byte optimizer reproduction.
